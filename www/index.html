            <p>Walk back towards the road junction (Crossbeck Road and Wells Road) and you will see a small car park with the sign, 
			as shown here.  This points the way, uphill, towards White Wells.</p>
			<p>There has been bathing at White Wells since 1703 when there was a bath to the rear of the premises. 
			This was replaced in 1791 by two baths, one of which is still on display today. 
			Although the water has no significant mineral content, it is the coldness of the water, which stimulates the circulation.</p>
			<p>White Wells was instrumental in establishing Ilkley as a spa town. 
			A number of large hydros were built in the Ilkley area during the 19th century where people could come to "take the waters", 
			believing all manner of ailments could be cured.</p>
			<p>Charles Darwin visited Ilkley in 1859 and is believed to have "taken the waters" at White Wells. 
			Modern day visitors can still use the plunge bath.  
			New Year's Day is the most popular day for this activity, with usually over a hundred plungers throughout the day.  
			However, providing it is quiet enough in the cafe they can usually open the bath gate should visitors wish to plunge 
			at other times of the year too. Plungers must supply their own bathing costumes and towels and the activity is 
			undertaken at the plunger's own risk! 
			There is no charge for plunging, but bathers can buy a certificate to mark the occasion, throw some loose change into 
			the bath and of course support the cafe.</p>
			<p>White Wells is open on New Year's Day and at weekends 2pm - 5pm during school holidays, particularly the summer holidays.  
			However, White Wells is always open when the flags are flying and closed when the flags are not flying.</p>
			<p>This walk does not include a diversion to White Wells as the path can be muddy and includes steps and it is a 
			few hundred yards away uphill but, for those fit enough, please break off our walk for a visit and return back to 
			this car park.</p>
